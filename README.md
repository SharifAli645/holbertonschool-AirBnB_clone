## Description

This is the first part of a big project to create a clone of AirBnB. This part of the project is called **The console**. In this project we will cover the basic implementations that will build a complete clone of the AirBnB web page. Before we explain how to run and how to install this project, we will explain some concepts that will help you understand the flow of the classes (packages, modules, circular imports, etc).

## Technical concepts

These concepts are very important. You need to understand them or at least have a general understanding about how they work and how they are applied.
### unittest
This Python's module is a testing framework that allows us to write test cases. It provides a set of classes, methods and assertions to verify if our code works as expected. To work with this module we need to import it `import unittest`
+ Examples of using unittest module

### *args and **kwargs
+ Examples (add images here)
### packages
In Python, a package is a special folder or directory that contains related modules and the __init__.py file that indicates that the folder is a package, and initializes and defines the behavior of the package.
```
my_package/
	__init__.py
	module_1.py
	module_2.py
```
### serialization - deserialization
Serialization: Serialization is the process of converting an object or data structure into a stream of bytes for storage or transmission.

Deserialization: Deserialization is the reverse process of serialization.
```
import json

# Data
data = {'nombre': 'Juan','edad': 30}

# Serialization to JSON
data_serial = json.dumps(data)

# Deserialization from JSON
data_deserial = json.loads(data_serial)

```

### cmd
In Python, cmd is a module that allows you to create an interactive command line interface.
```
import cmd

class Console(cmd.Cmd):
	"""code"""

# Function that starts an interactive console command loop
Console().cmdloop()
```
### circular import
+ Examples
### modules
+ Examples

## Installation
+ The first step to get this repo is cloning it:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/xiayudev/holbertonschool-AirBnB_clone.git
```
+ After that, go into the directory:
```bash
cd ./holbertonschool-AirBnB_clone
```
+ Once there, make sure to give execution permissions to the console:
```bash
chmod u+x console.py # Add sudo at the beginning if needed
```
## Usage
There are two ways of using our console. When I say console I mean the command interpreter that allows us to create, destroy, store, etc, data (instances).
+ Interactive mode
```bash
python3 console.py
```
or
```bash
./console.py
```
+ Non-interactive mode
```bash
$ cat test_file
$ help
$ cat test_file | ./console.py
```
